Getting Help
============

The best way for you to get help is to contact me by stopping in my office.  The second best is for you to email me your question, and your code.  The answers to many of your questions may also be in the textbook, but I realize that you may not be following everything in the text, and so some additional explanation might be useful.  What about googling for some help?  I would strongly encourage you to NOT google for an answer.  Many of the answers you might find by googling will lead you down a bad path.  Its not that they are wrong it is just that many of the answers you are likely to find are meant for programmers with much more experience.  The exeption to this is [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com).  The answers on w3schools are going to be short, to the point, and good for beginners.  So, if you want to be efficient with your time, I recommend you stick to the resources I have mentioned here when you need help.


Class Requirements: 
===================

Participation
-------------

“The teacher’s job is to design learning experiences, not primarily to
impart information” This is going to be an experiential class, I’ll
lecture some and try to explain some big picture stuff but, I’ve learned
everything I know in this area by doing stuff. I expect you to be
engaged and to ask questions and do stuff. If you stop at the bare
minimum of what I ask you to do for any particular assignment you’ll be
missing an opportunity.

Homework
--------

You will have at least weekly homework assignments, sometimes more
frequently when they are easier.   I will often ask you to complete something that we started working on in class by the beginning of the next class.  This type of assignment counts toward your class participation grade.


Grading
-------

    60%   Homework Assignments
    30%   Weekly Quizzes
    10%   Class participation

The grading scale is:

    90 -- 100   A
    80 -- 89    B
    70 -- 79    C
