Class Requirements: 
===================

Participation
-------------

“The teacher’s job is to design learning experiences, not primarily to
impart information” This is going to be an experiential class, I’ll
lecture some and try to explain some big picture stuff but, I’ve learned
everything I know in this area by doing stuff. I expect you to be
engaged and to ask questions and do stuff. If you stop at the bare
minimum of what I ask you to do for any particular assignment you’ll be
missing an opportunity.

Homework
--------

You will have at least weekly homework assignments, sometimes more
frequently when they are easier.

Mashups

The final mashup will be a substantial part of your grade. You will
need to design and implement a mashup, then you’ll present a demo of it
to the class when it is all done. Many of today’s successful web
businesses started out as simple mashups. If you desire you can work
with one other person on the mid-term.

-   Create a web page/pages that utilize one or more Web APIs

-   Built with Javascript, CSS, and HTML

-   Examples of available APIs

-   Google Documents, Maps, Calendar, etc.

-   Twitter, Facebook

-   Amazon, Evernote, Dropbox, RTM, tweedledo

-   Movies, Music, Books, ...

-   1000’s of others

-   Combine one or more of these web services to create your own cool
    service
