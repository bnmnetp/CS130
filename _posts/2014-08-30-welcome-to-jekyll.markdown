Welcome.  I'm using my own system instead of Katie this semester.  I'll post updates and assignments here.  I'll add deadlines and assignments to the google calendar for the course as well.

The textbook for the course is one that I wrote during the previous 7 weeks, you can find it on my website
[interactivepython.org](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/webfundamentals/index.html "interactivepython.org").   Please register for the course `webfundamentals` and register for the section CS130B.

Thanks
