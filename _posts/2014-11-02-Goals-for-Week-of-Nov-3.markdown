  * At least 10 items
  * Some items must be high, medium, and low priority.  The different items should display differently to distinguish their priority
  * Some items should be complete, these items should have a line through them.
  * for bonus points, see if you can change the style of the list to display a checkmark when the task is complete.
  * Save your file as ``todo.html``  Your style rules should be in ``todo.css``  Sync this to github.
