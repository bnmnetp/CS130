* Make a web page that represents your Grocery shopping list.  Your list must have the following:
  * At least 10 items
  * Your entire page should have a grocery theme to it.  Whatever that means.
  * The items in your list should be categorized according to what kind of item they are.  For example, meat, produce, canned goods, cleaning, personal, etc.  The items should be colored or styled to make it easy to see the difference.  You should have at least four different categories of items.
  * Some items could be in your cart, these items should have a line through them.
  * for bonus points, see if you can change the style of the list to display a checkmark when an item is in your cart.
  * Save your file as ``shopping.html``  Your style rules should be in ``shop.css``
  * Make a link ``<a href="shopping.html">shopping</a>``  in your index.html file, so that I can find your shopping list easily.
